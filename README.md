# myAttendances
This is my degree assignment for Harokopio University of Athens, built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL2**. The project is a web application that allows students to mark their attendance for lab or theory lectures in the classes they are enrolled in. The platform also supports **CRUD operations** for teaching, administrative, and secretarial staff, enabling them to manage classes, courses, and attendance records according to their roles and permissions.
